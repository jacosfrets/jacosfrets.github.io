## What Is This?

I've refrained over the years from posting my real photography on social media. I've felt that the platforms that exist out there are inadequate for me to properly convey the meaning behind each image. I've waitied until I could tailor the medium to best reflect the media. 

Above anything else, this is a journal. I dont expect many people are going to read this and thats not the point. I write entries like these posts in my journal every day. This website gives me an excuse to practice my HTML and to collect my thoughts about my shots. It also makes it easier to share pictures with people.

## Photos

Everything on this website is open source and easy to access. If you like a picture, feel free to [download it](https://github.com/jacosfrets/jacosfrets.github.io/tree/master/images). That being said, these images are my property, and I have the negatives for all of them. If you'd like to post them on social media, please place a link to this blog and the story behind the picture you are posting: 

[https://jacosfrets.github.io](https://jacosfrets.github.io)

I don't mean to be hyperbolic, but there is a reason why I have gone to great lengths to present my pictures this way instead of posting them on instagram. I have a personal connection with them, and I feel their stories should be told if they are to be made public.

I will contact someone if I plan to put a picture of them on this blog. Technically in Canada one has the right to record and photograph anyone in a public place without their consent but I know better than to collect on this. The most exciting things happen in private places anyhow ;)

A sharp eye will be able to tell that the pictures aren't professionally scanned. I'm working on this.

## Analytics and Data Collection

Fuck Google, fuck analytics, and fuck tracking people. I have no idea how many people visit this site if any, nor will I ever. The only sign I'll ever have that someone has visited this is if they [contact me](http://jacosfrets.github.io/contact/) or if they post it somewhere. 

## Contact

Like I said, theres no analytics. Typing in a message goes straight to one of my emails. I'd love to hear from you. Does a picture strike a chord with you? Make you feel a certain way?

## Website Design

I employ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to edit this website and github pages to host it. As a physicist I encounter code a lot, but web design is not my fort√©. The layout of this website was crafted by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) ([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)) and his team. A full list of contributors and access to some website templates is avaiable open source on his [Github](https://github.com/johno/pixyll).

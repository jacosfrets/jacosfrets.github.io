### Website Design

The purpose of this blog is not to exercise my coding as much as it is to open my computer and simply write. As such, I employ [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to edit this website and github pages to host it. As a physicist I encounter code a lot, but web design is not my fort√©. The layout of this website was crafted by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) ([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)) and his team. A full list of contributors and access to some website templates is avaiable open source on his [Github](https://github.com/johno/pixyll).
